The tangent and subtended angle theorem states that, The angle between a tanget and a chord to a circle is equal to the angle which the chord subtends in the alternate sigment.

An angle is the space (usually measured in degrees) between two intersecting lines or surfaces at or close to the point where they meet.

A tangent is a line or plane that touches a circle or curve at one point.

A chord is a straight line joining the ends of an arc.

A construction is to draw or delineate (a geometrical figure) accurately to given conditions.

angles and chord relationship : Angles subtentded by the same chord are equal( A lemma ).


A lemma is a subsidiary or intermediate theorem in an argument or proof.

A theoem is a proposition or rule in mathematics proved by a chain of reasoning.




First of tan,  The Idea here really is to prove that angle x  = angle y ,First start by construction,That is draw a straight line passing throught the origin O to a point on the circumference C ,and a line from B to C. This makes a new angle, call it z.

Second line of tan line thrm : Now ,let angle(OAB) be a ,OCB be z. From  a lemma, OAT  = 90 (reason : straight line from origin perpendicular to tangent).

Third tan : From the previous statement we can say a + x = 90 , which simply implies x = 90 - a.

fourth  tan : Now , triangle ABC ( sum of interior angles  = 180), which means a + z + n = 180. But then,  n = 90( reason: an angle subtended by the diameter equals 90).

fifth  tan: Following this argument , we can say z + a = 90 ( see z + a + 90 = 180). Which then implies that  z = 90 - a . 

sixth tan: We have z = 90 - a , and  x = 90 - a. This then shows x = z. 

seventh tan By lemma : An angle subtended by the same chord or arc are are equal. In this case z = y. which then completes our proof ,Fun logic ,mathematics is great.
